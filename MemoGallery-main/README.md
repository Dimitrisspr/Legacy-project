# MemoGallery

The MemoGallery is where we keep our memories alive.
In this Project A gallery storage is going to be build so everyone can have their own private space to save their photo.
In order to add a picture we need to give the url of the photo, timeline and description.
Every Photo is going to have a like button so when your liking the photo it will go to the favorite section.
